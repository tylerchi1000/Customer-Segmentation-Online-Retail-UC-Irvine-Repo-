# Customer Segmentation Online Retail

 * This project is focused on segmenting customers based on their purchase history and behavior using data analysis techniques. The goal is to identify different groups of customers with similar characteristics and behaviors to better target marketing efforts and improve overall business performance.
Data Sources

* This is a transnational data set which contains all the transactions occurring between 01/12/2010 and 09/12/2011 for a UK-based and registered non-store online retail.The company mainly sells unique all-occasion gifts. Many customers of the company are wholesalers.

## Methodology

The analysis consists of several steps, including data cleaning and preparation, exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, and model building.

The main techniques used for customer segmentation include:

    RFM Analysis: This technique uses recency, frequency, and monetary value to segment customers based on their purchase behavior.
    Clustering: This technique uses machine learning algorithms to group customers based on their shared characteristics and behaviors.

## Results

The analysis identified three main customer segments:

    High-Value Customers: These are customers who have made a large number of purchases and spent a significant amount of money

    Consistant Customers: Customers who make purchases consitantly

    Low-Engagement Customers: Customers that have minimal purchases and engagement with the retailer. By some definitions may have churned.  

The results of the analysis can be used to develop targeted marketing campaigns for each customer segment, such as offering discounts to high-value customers and re-engaging with churned customers.
